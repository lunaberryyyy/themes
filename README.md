My personal theme for [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) / [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app)[^1].

A theme based loosely on 2024 Discord before the 2025 Discord Visual Refresh (DVR), designed to remove many annoyances that the DVR introduced, to clean up UI clutter, introduce QOL ideas like emoji italicization and title bar notification banners, etc.

[^1]: While there should be no issues when using the theme with BetterDiscord, both of the primary maintaners use Vencord, as such BD is not explicitly tested against prior to pushing. This also means that some changes specific to [Vencord's bundled plugins](https://vencord.dev/plugins), that may not work with their BD counterparts, YMMV.
